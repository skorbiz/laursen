/*
STYLE GUIDE FOR TIMELINE ENTRIES:

When converting draft text to polished text, follow these guidelines:
1. AVOID excessive positive words like 'advanced', 'pioneering', 'cutting-edge' - they sound like sales pitch
2. FOCUS on precise descriptions of tasks and technologies used
3. EMPHASIZE technology keywords and specific accomplishments
4. KEEP language professional but not boastful
5. PRIORITIZE concrete details over abstract praise
6. USE active voice and specific action verbs
7. INCLUDE quantifiable results when possible

Good: "Developed navigation stack for autonomous mobile robots using ROS2 Control and Nav2"
Bad: "Pioneered cutting-edge advanced navigation solutions for revolutionary autonomous robots"
